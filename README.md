## Getting started 

### 💻 [Install Node.js ](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/wiki/New-Chapter-Setup#installation-instructions)

### 📝 Install an editor of your choice 
 
Recommended Editors: 

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Every proper text editor is suitable.

### 🕹 Choose a [workshopper](http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list)

- if you have no prior JavaScript experience, we recommend [javascripting](https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting) as a start
- to get started with Node.js, [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) is the way to go

Install a worshop via `npm install -g WORKSHOPNAME_HERE` (i.e. `npm install -g learnyounode`). (-g is necessary and means "global")

### ❓ How Workshoppers work

Once you installed a workshopper, you can start it via calling the workshop name i.e. `learnyounode`. It will show you instructions on what to do and there are some hints on how to solve the exercices. 

Choose a folder on you machine and create a new Node.js file with the editor of your choice. 

- `learnyounode run /path/to/your/program.js` runs your program is a test environment, so you can see the output. 
- `learnyounode verify /path/to/your/program.js` compares your solution with the expected values. 

If your solution is correct, the workshoppers tells you so and you can choose the next exercises by calling `learnyounode`. 


### 🖖 Get help when you're stuck 

Feel free to ask a mentor when you're stuck or uncertain about your solution or an excercise. Just raise your hand or ask directly. We are here to help!
